# classification

The purpose of this repository is to explore documentation and package building
(in my spare time) via `usethis`, `roxygen2`, and `devtools`.

The core code forms a basic pattern recognition system, created in completing
the assignments and final project for the course COMP 5107: Statistical and
Syntactic Pattern Recognition at Carleton University (Winter 2022). It
implements classification techniques such as:

- Discriminant analysis
- Fisher's discriminant
- Ho-Kashyap algorithm
- K nearest neighbours

I don't think this will ever become a "legit" package since I'm not including
any checks on user inputs.
